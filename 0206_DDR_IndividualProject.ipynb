It has a little wall for cats to navigate around- my effort to keep litter off the floor. It does an okay job but could use some modification to catch more litter… it looks a heckuva lot better than a cat box! Probably better for a small to medium sized cat, dunno how a larger cat would fare…Email me if you want any or all of this stuff!!Oh! And a little bridge I made and never got around to putting up.
